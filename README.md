# TSLTO
TSLTO (Tucker decomposition-based Sparse Low-Rank high-Order Tensor Optimization model) is a model for tensor imputation and anomaly diagnosis. Specific model and evaluations can be found at paper [Traffic Flow Data Completion and Anomaly Diagnosis via Sparse and Low-Rank Tensor Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02245 "our paper").
